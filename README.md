# Road-Danger-Reporter

## Overview
This project represents my solution to the final exam for the Object-Oriented Programming module at my university. The application is designed to facilitate communication among drivers while also serving as a platform for reporting road dangers (who reported them, their description and their location). Upon validation by fellow drivers, reported road dangers are visually represented as circles on a simulated map. 

Note: although designed to run on a single device, the application simulates multiple users by opening multiple windows, thus testing the system's scalability.

## Features
- built using layered architecture
- implements the observer design pattern, which allows changes (messages sent, dangers reported) made by one user to be seen seen by all other users
- follows the OOP paradigm
- features a graphical mock up map
- drivers can only validate reports which are phisically close to them
- any modifications to the repository data made during the execution of the application will persist

## Technologies used
- C++ 
- Qt for the GUI

## Screenshots
**Note: The GUI was not a primary concern during the development of this project, which I completed by myself within a timeframe of 2 and a half hours. The emphasis was on functionality rather than visual appeal.**
